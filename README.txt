The arduino SEN5X class is a sensor interface for the SEN5X series of
environmental sensors. I started this project to teach myself how to build
software for communicating with periphrials using an arduino.

When I first worked on this, my code was far from ideal, and I have learned
a lot since then. This time around I'm rewriting everything into something
much easier to use and or comprehend.

What I have done so far:
    I've completed (but have not tested) all of the getters
