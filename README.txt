This is very WIP and subject to change. I cannot gurantee forward/backwards compatibility of methods until 1.0.

I've implemented everything in the official documentation save for getting specific sensor status flags.

I've tested sending commands and getting data from the sensor, but I have not tested the set methods. See the .ino file for basic usage.

All of the set/get methods require a pointer to the data you want to r/w to. (for now).
